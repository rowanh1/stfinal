This is a replication package for my STA 215: Applied Statistics for Social Scientists class’ final project. My group mates and I randomly selected 16 episodes from the TV show Stranger Things and collected data from each scene within the episodes. 

## **Instructions**
To access the script, open the “sta215-rowan.R” file, which contains the code I utilized within this project. To access the dataset, open the “stfinal dataset.xlsx” file and then select “View raw”.

## **Data**
The data collected for this project was taken from scenes from randomly selected episodes of Stranger Things. We had five different concepts (emotional tone, visual effects, romance, audio effects, plot) with 17 variables falling into one of the five concept categories. Within this project we were testing a wide variety of comparisons in this project, such as noting whether songs were more or less likely to be playing depending on the amount of humor within a scene. As a group, we recorded a range of qualitative and quantitative variables: crying, the presence of blood, fight scenes, kisses, 11 using her powers, deaths, angriness, happiness, music, creatures, the name “Will” being said, flashbacks, humor, Dungeons and Dragons being referenced, content pertinence, and the IMDb rating of the episode. 

## **Operationalization**
For each of the quantitative variables collected (number of kisses, times 11 uses her powers, deaths in a scene, creatures, times the name “Will” is said, times there is a flashback, times there is humor, and times Dungeons and Dragons is referenced in a scene) we simply recorded the number of each time the variable occurred within the scene. For example, if the name “Will” was called 3 times in a scene, we would record the number “3”. 

For each of the qualitative variables collected (presence of crying, blood, a fight, anger, happiness, music, relevant content, good episode rating, and bad episode rating) we operationally defined the presence of these variables with a “1” and the absence of these variables with a “0”. For example, if there is music playing in a scene, we would record a “1”, and if there is no music, we would record a “0”.
